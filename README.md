# DESI Dark Energy Analysis

A simple Jupyter Notebook for exploring and visualizing three dark energy (DE) models from the DESI collaboration's paper "Extended Dark Energy analysis using DESI DR2 BAO measurements" using the CLASS Boltzmann code via Python. This project is designed as a starting point for future, more detailed dark energy analyses and comparisons.

---

## Overview

This repository contains a Python Jupyter Notebook that:
- Interfaces with the CLASS Boltzmann code
- Plots results for three selected dark energy models
- Provides a foundation for future extensions in dark energy research
